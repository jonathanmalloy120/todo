# todo
A basic todo list built with react. Code has been refactored so that it is cleaner. Some basic styling has been applied to make it look a little nicer than the default. 

#future additions
1. Make the tasks alternate between dark and light gray
2. add the capability to mark tasks as complete without removing them (which is why tasks currently appear with red font, successful completion will turn them green).
